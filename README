A PHP 5 script to re-syndicate an RSS feed to identi.ca / Laconica.

h@x0red By Zach Copley (http://identi.ca/zach)

Give this script an RSS feed to suck on, and it will spit the latest
items in the feed out as dents on your indenti.ca/Laconica account,
and automatically hashtag items based on search terms you specify.

Uses ur1.ca to shorten urls.  Requires PHP 5 and SimplePie 1.1.1. 

The source code is licensed under the AGPLv3 (not including SimplePie).
